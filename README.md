- Hi, I’m @mahalkiel, known to some as Mike or even Michael.
- 👀 I’m interested in permafrost microbiology. This repo is intended to become a package to help interogate metagenomic data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Python in order to complete my Master's degree in biology - but also because they are really interesting and powerful tools.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational biology projects in my area of biology.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at michael.snyder.90@my.csun.edu
