- Hi, I’m @mahalkiel, known to some as Mike or even Michael. I'm a graduate student at California State University Northridge.
- I’m interested in the microbiology of permafrost soils. This repo is intended to interogate metagenomic data to determine if arctic paleovegetation is correlated to other taxa.
- I’m currently learning bash, R and Python in order to analyze my data.
- One of the purposes of this project is to create useful tools.
- How to reach me: email me at michael.snyder.90@my.csun.edu
