- Hi, I’m @mahalkiel, known to some as Mike or even Michael.
- I’m interested microbiology, specifically the microbiology of permafrost soils. This repo is intended to become a package to help interogate metagenomic data previously recovered.
- I’m currently learning R and Python in order to understand my data.
- I’m looking to collaborate on computational biology projects in my area of biology. One of the purposes of this project is to create useful tools.
- How to reach me: email me at michael.snyder.90@my.csun.edu
